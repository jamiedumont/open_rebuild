        <h2>Building momentum with some simple CSS</h2>
        <date>07 October 2020</date>

        <p>
          Sticking with the theme of leaving this project much longer than
          intended, I finally got back to making some progress.
          My other work has seen me buried in writing CSS lately, so I thought
          that a good way back in would be to put together a simple
          stylesheet to move the site away from the browser defaults.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, my approach to writing CSS has changed since the last time I
          wrote about it. Longterm readers may recall how I wrote enthusiastically about
          <a href="https://archive.jamiedumont.co.uk/blog/tachyons">Tachyons</a> back in
          2016. Since then, TailwindCSS has taken the development world by storm
          and that's pretty much what I've been using since &ndash; even purchasing the TailwindUI library of components.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's been a very comfortable framework to use &mdash; once you've got
          <code>tailwind.config.js</code>, <code>purge.config.js</code>, and
          whatever build tool you're using all set up. To be clear, getting a
          TailwindCSS setup working "just so" is not a trivial exercise, but the
          benefits always felt worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
          That was until I needed to work on a project that had a shared "core"
          with multiple, variable implementations. This approach wasn't just for
          business logic but design too. Each application needed to look
          similar, even sharing some pages, but each needed to be "reskinned" to
          use brand colours, fonts, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>"Oh easy!"</i> I thought, <i>"This is what CSS was designed for, I'll just use the cascade or some
            custom properties to apply different styles"</i>. Turns out it
          wasn't so easy... I ended up having the same variables declared in the
          Tailwind config and in CSS custom properties. I started getting into
          specifity issues &mdash; something I had even forgotten was a thing!
          &mdash; and struggled to make the changes in each application without
          upsetting the shared core. I could feel myself being
          torn between how Tailwind works and how CSS is supposed to work.
        </p>

        <p>
          By treating CSS as single-purpose utility classes, all with
          equivalent specifity Tailwind had removed one of CSS' biggest pitfalls
          but also removed it's biggest strength. Tailwind is popular with JS
          developers because it suits the way their applications are built with
          CSS that is scoped to localised components, but
          CSS is fundamentally about the cascade &mdash; it's in the name after
          all!
        </p>

        <p>
          I went back to writing BEM-based CSS which is how I did things prior
          to the atomic approaches. I was immediately reminded how clumsy and
          verbose it was, but only because my CSS skills had dulled. I had
          gotten lazy and failed to see the big picture which is vital to
          writing good CSS. Instead of writing generic
          <code>.media-object</code>-type classes, I was writing incredibly
          specific classes for single elements &mdash; much like I was still
          styling with Tailwind.
        </p>

        <h3>Enter Andy Bell</h3>

        <p>
          I searched around trying to find some direction and remembered I had
          bookmarked <a href="https://every-layout.dev">'Every Layout'</a> a while back but not really
          looked into it. The idea is that it provides a textbook example of how to build
          every primative layout you'll likely need for any website. There were
          the usual suspects like centering items and the good 'ol media object,
          but I wasn't prepared for what I found.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking through the free layouts didn't much inspire me, but when I
          read the <a href="https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/boxes/">'Rudiments'</a> series of articles that accompany the layouts, it
          was a complete revelation. In five short articles, Andy explained how
          CSS was designed to be used and how to embrace this rather than fight
          it. I've been doing frontend development for eight years now and these
          five articles taught me more than all the blog posts and books I've
          read.
        </p>

        <p>
          I won't enumerate all of the concepts behind this was of writing CSS
          and instead I encourage you to read his work both on <a href="https://every-layout.dev">
            Every Layout</a> and <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/">his own site, Picalil.li</a> where he expands
          these ideas to a more formal methodology he calls CUBE CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          By all means, take a look at the source code of this site, either
          here in the browser, or on <a href="https://github.com/jamiedumont/open_rebuild">GitHub</a> and see for yourself
          how much you can do with very little CSS!

        <h2>Writing a brief</h2>
        <date>10 July 2020</date>

        <p>
          Been a little longer than I said it would hasn't it?! Never
          mind...
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to start a new project by roughing out a brief of some
          kind. It's never too long and detailed as I like to be able to
          take advantage of the things I learn along the
          way, but there needs to be some direction. I find
          that stating the requirements, examining the shareholders of
          the project and perhaps identifying some constraints or possible
          issues early are all that's needed. Once I get started I tend to
          use Basecamp's <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> process to build each
          feature or requirement. This gets me out of the gate and building
          something "real" quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>The Brief in brief</h3>
        <ul class="stack">

          <li>
            <strong>Post articles</strong> &mdash; I'd obviously like to be able
            to write. Articles will be pretty varied in length &ndash; some pretty
            long! &ndash; so I'd like to provide in-article navigation.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Post 'photosets'</strong> &mdash; Photography has always
            been my thing. I've flirted with professional photography a few times
            but much prefer to <a
                                 href="https://petapixel.com/2015/03/14/go-pro-maybe-what-you-need-is-to-go-amateur/">"go amateur"</a>. I don't use Instagram
                               anymore but would still like a place to share individual photos and
                               also larger "photosets" that tell a story and are accompanied by a few
                               words.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Going with the grain of the web</strong> &mdash; This will
            mean using proper, semantic HTML markup with all the attributes
            required to be a11y and SEO friendly. Using HTML for markup, CSS
            for styling and JS only where necessary. A bonus of this
            approach is that it should be fast and work well for years without suffering
            web-rot.</li>

          <li><strong>Static pages</strong> &mdash; For the defacto "about" and
            "work" pages.</li>

          <li><strong>Lists</strong> &mdash; I'd like to experiment with public
            watching/reading/listening lists. Something that also occured to
            me was consolidating the hundreds of browser bookmarks that I
            don't really look at (even though I saved these pages for a
            reason, so should!) into a public reference on different
            topics.</li>

          <li><strong>HTML caching</strong> &mdash; Static sites are great...until
            they aren't. I can get pretty far with my likely web stack of
            choice (more on that later) but adding full HTML caching will
            take a lot of load off the application if I ever get a spike in
            traffic.</li>

          <li><strong>RSS &amp; JSON feeds</strong> &mdash; I'm ashamed to say that
            my site has never had either. Something I'd like to rectify</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Other features I'm considering</h4>
        <ul class="stack">

          <li>
            <strong>Private posts</strong> &mdash; To navigate around my
            avoidance of social media it might be nice to share articles and
            photosets that only select people like family and friends can see.
            This will require a lot of work relative to the results so may ultimately
            end up on the never-ending back burner.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Email digests</strong> &mdash; I'd like people to be able to sign up for email digests at
            regular intervals (for example once per week, once per month or
            as new posts are made) without using a newsletter provider like
            Mailchimp. By building it myself I can keep user's email
            addresses out of a third party's hands and automate the content
            of each email.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Objectives &amp; Constraints</h3>

        <h4>Tool-less front end development</h4>

        <p>
          I initially thought it might be a good idea to explore
          <i>"precompilation"</i> as the driving
          concept of the software design; optimising the deliverables as much as possible ahead of any requests.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, static sites and tools like Webpack are pretty much end game in this regard and I've
          been down that road before. I found that going 100% static actually creates as
          many problems as it solves, and that there's real value to
          having a running application behind a site, even if it <i>*could*</i> get
          overwhelmed in a traffic spike.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also a bit tired of all my CSS and JS needing a
          compilation step. I've become a big fan of StimulusJS and TailwindCSS, but
          to get the best out of them you really need to be using Webpack.
          This isn't the end of the world because at this point I've already
          sunk the time into understanding it. However, I always feel
          uncomfortable adding it to a project &ndash; it just feels fragile and
          brittle &ndash; and open up the project to a world of <code>npm</code> and a huge
          <code>node_modules</code> folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, I'd like to concentrate on writing and delivering
          human-readable code without a compilation step where possible. This
          improves the value of the code as a learning resource both for me and
          any one that chooses to take a look at the source code. That was how I
          &mdash; and many other developers my age &mdash; learnt to build websites.
        </p>


        <p>
          Besides, I don't intend to use much JS so Webpack would primarily have
          been concatenating files and optimising images in a single command.
          This is something that <code>MAKE</code> or even a simple bash script
          can accomplish, without bringing half of all Javascript ever written
          along for the ride.
        </p>

        <h4>Is a database "right" for content?</h4>

        <p>
          Representing content as data rather than markup allows for templates to generate the
          precise HTML required, whilst also keeping design and content as
          distinct entities &mdash; something that's important if you ever want
          to update the design without migrating your past content to a new
          format.
        </p>

        <p>
          Changes to content shouldn't (always) require changes to templates and
          vice versa. In reality however, the two are dependant on each other
          and ultimately using a markup language like HTML or Markdown provides
          a much clearer idea of the content and how it will be displayed. The
          cherry on top is that using a tool like <code>git</code> to
          version-control your content provides a litany of benefits over
          content stored as rows &amp; columns inside a database.
        </p>

        <p>
          The issue is that using markup often creates a technical-bar that must
          be met in order to contribute to a site. You need to know HTML (or
          something simpler like Markdown) in order to write new articles and
          edit old ones. That's why most CMS' will
          provide an editing interface regardless of how the content is stored
          &mdash; and once you've got an interface and abstracted away the
          markup, you may as well use a database for the benefits they can
          offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          As mentioned in my first post, I've always marvelled at Paul Stamatious's site and
          particularly his photosets. The layout and design is incredibly varied
          and nuanced with lots of small edge cases that make it look just right.
          I've always wondered how complex his templates must be to allow for all
          those variations. Turns out he actually authors his site in HTML rather
          than Markdown so that he has the control over the layout that he
          needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This leaves me in a quandry. I don't particularly want to be writing
          HTML whenever I write a post, but it does genuinely seem to be the
          favourable approach unless I want to build a complex editing
          interface. This is something I'll need to explore in a future post.
        </p>

        <h2>The Open Rebuild Begins</h2>

        <date>08 June 2020</date>

        <p>It seems that 2020 is the year of the open site rebuild. So far I've watched as <a href="https://destroytoday.com/blog/hello-world">Jonnie</a>, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/">Frank</a> and now <a href="https://nathansnelgrove.com/redesign-2020/">Nathan</a> put their thought &amp; work process out there for the world to see.</p>

        <p>My site isn't more than a collection of a few blog posts these days, but I've had big plans for it since about 2018, at least according to my journals. I've wanted to post more of my photography, share smaller thoughts more often but also have a place for deep dives and series. Inspiration unashamedly taken from <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/"> Paul's site.</a></p>

        <p>These plans scared me. They are big and imposing, and I struggle to <s>find</s> make time to even update my Twitter bio. An open, incremental rebuild seemed the perfect solution.</p>

        <p>However, whilst I cut my teeth on design, I'm primarily a developer these days, so my public rebuild is going to be a bit different. I'll cover the (minimal) design decisions that I make, but this is going to be about the code that runs the site.</p>

        <p>This site has been built 100 different ways at this point - all of them complete overkill considering it's needs. My personal site has always been a place for to experiment with new ideas and test new technologies. Given all this, you're probably anticipating that I start talking about the hot JS framework du-jour, but instead I'll stop you there.</p>

        <p>Rapidly moving from designer to developer, I missed a lot on the way, most of which could be considered fundamentals. I spent a whole week with only the most basic of CSS selectors before jumping into SASS frameworks (it wasn't Bootstap...what was the other big one?). I learnt JS whilst building a marketplace with MeteorJS &amp; React (that was a wild ride). Using Meteor meant using Mongo, so I was very late to the SQL party!</p>

        <p>I'll be doing my best to follow Jeremy's <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">Resilient Web Design</a> principles, using the native tools of the web to their fullest before cracking open anything more complex. I'll be server-side rendering everything, and I might even stick to using flat files. In short, I'll be coding like it's 1995!</p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>

        <p>This seems like an odd thing to do right? Well, as I said, I missed a lot of the fundamentals along the way. I learnt pretty much everything I know about development from reading blogs online, and the problem is that most blogs - particularly today - only talk about building with the hottest of hot tech. Those fundamentals just aren't sexy enough to get much screen time, but they are kinda... y'know... fundamental.</p>

        <p>That's why I want to build this site in the open, always taking the simplest, most resilient and durable path I can; documenting it all the way with articles, guides and source code. I'll examine my options and explain my decisions as I go. I learnt so much from the open web: it's time I gave something back.</p>

        <p>I'm going to be doing this around regular work and looking after an 18 month-old that's just starting to learn his own mind (no easy feat itself) so I can't say how long this will take, or when the next post will go up. I'll try to find a rhythm and make regular updates, but bear with me whilst I find my feet again. It's been a while since shipping <i>anything</i>!</p>

        <p>You'll find the git repo with all the source below, along with a link to my (now) old site. In time I'll move the old content over too.</p>

        <p>That's all for now!</p>
