      <h1>2020 Site Redesign</h1>

      <h2>Writing a brief</h2>
      <date>10 July 2020</date>

      <p>Been a little longer than I said it would hasn't it?! Never
        mind...</p>

      <p>I always start a new project by roughing out a brief of some
        kind. It's never too long and detailed as I like to be able to
        take advantage of the serendipitous discoveries I make along the
        way, but there needs to be some approximate objectives. I find
        that stating the requirements, examining the shareholders of
        the project and perhaps identifying some constraints or possible
        issues early are all that's needed. Once I get started I tend to
        use Basecamp's <a href="#">Shape Up</a> process to build each
        feature or requirement. This provides enough information that I
        can get started quickly without wasting time on plans that never
        get referred to again.</p>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Post articles</strong> &mdash; I'd obviously like to be able
          to write. This will be longform writing as well as shorter
          thoughts. No "hot takes" though; I promise!</li>
        <li><strong>Post 'photosets'</strong> &mdash; I don't use Instagram
          anymore so I'd like a place to share my photography. I'm a big
          proponent of using photography to tell stories (as opposed to
          single "bangers" that look great on the 'gram but are otherwise
          meaningless) so I'll be looking to post groups of photos with some supporting copy and
          metadata to provide more context to the images.</li>
        <li><strong>Going with the grain of the web</strong> &mdash; This will
          mean using proper, semantic HTML markup with all the attributes
          required to be a11y and SEO friendly. Using HTML for markup, CSS
          for styling and JS only where necessary. A bonus of this
          approach is that it should be fast and work well for years without suffering
          web-rot.</li>
        <li><strong>Static pages</strong> &mdash; For the defacto "about" and
          "work" pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Lists</strong> &mdash; I'd like to experiment with public
          watching/reading/listening lists. Something that also occured to
          me was consolidating the hundreds of browser bookmarks that I
          don't really look at (even though I saved these pages for a
          reason, so should!) into a public reference on different
          topics.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML caching</strong> &mdash; Static sites are great...until
          they aren't. I can get pretty far with my likely web stack of
          choice (more on that later) but adding full HTML caching will
          take a lot of load off the application if I ever get a spike in
          traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>RSS &amp; JSON feeds</strong> &mdash; I'm ashamed to say that
          my site has never had either. Something I'd like to rectify</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Potential ideas</h4>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Private posts</strong> &mdash; Again to navigate around my
          avoidance of social media, perhaps some posts of family
          adventures and the like which only select people can view. Will
          require a lot of work relative to the results so may ultimately
          end up on the never-ending back burner.</li>
        <li><strong>Email digests</strong> &mdash; I don't use much social media,
          so I'd like people to be able to sign up for email digests at
          regular intervals (for example once per week, once per month or
          as new posts are made) without using a newsletter provider like
          Mailchimp. By building it myself I can keep user's email
          addresses out of a third party's hands and automate the content
          of each email.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Objectives &amp; Constraints</h3>

      <h4>Precompilation</h4>
      <p>I initially thought it might be a good idea to explore "precompilation" as the driving
        concept of the software design: Optimising the deliverables as much as possible ahead of any requests.
        However, static sites are pretty much end game in this regard and I've
        been down that road and found that going 100% static actually creates as
        many problems as it solves. I think there's real value to
        having a running application behind a site, even if it *could* get
        overwhelmed in a traffic spike.</p>

      <p>I'm also a bit fed up of all my CSS and JS needing a
        compilation step. Instead I'd like to concentrate on writing and delivering
        human-readable code without a compilation step where possible. This
        improves the value of the code as a learning resource both for me and
        any one that chooses to take a look at the source code.</p>

      <p>I've lately become a big fan of StimulusJS and TailwindCSS, but
        to get the best out of them you really need to be using Webpack.
        This isn't the end of the world. At this point I've already
        sunk the time into understanding it, but I always feel
        uncomfortable adding it to a project - it just feels fragile and
        brittle.</p>

      <p>Of course I have to weigh this approach against the
        ultimate performance of the site. Ditching Webpack isn't a valid
        excuse to suddenly be serving huge assets. This will likely
        require that I take an extremely conservative view on using
        libraries and frameworks. Not a bad idea, but it will come with a productivity
        penalty. As this is a personal project and one where a
        primary objective is exploring the web as it should be, it's a
        trade off I'm happy to make.</p>

      <h4>Database?</h4>
      <p>Representing content as data inside a database allows for templates to generate the
        precise HTML required, whilst also keeping design and content as distinct entities.
        <i>(*cough* looking at you Wordpress! *cough*)</i></p>

      <p>Changes to one shouldn't (always) require changes to the other. This
        seems to be exactly what I want, except that you largely lose the
        ability to author content without an interface specifically designed for
        the structure of that content and how fine-grained that data is can be a
        balancing act. Whilst a nice feature, an online editing
        interface is a huge undertaking, and I would like be able to at
        least view my content in any text editor, ideally write it there
        too.</p>

      <p>Using a database for content has always felt wrong to me. It creates
        more problems than it solves. Content is best
        represented as markup which is why we use things like HTML and Markdown,
        the latter becoming the default for most static site generators. Using
        git to version control your content is a compelling enough reason to
        store content as markup, rather than data.</p>

      <p>The problem is that HTML is cumbersome to type and Markdown loses a lot of
        it's appeal when you're adding lots of attributes to it - you end up
        writing HTML anyway.</p>

      <p>As mentioned in my first post, I've always marvelled at Paul Stamatious's site and
        particularly his photosets. The layout and design is incredibly varied
        and nuanced with lots of small edge cases that make it look just right.
        I've always wondered how complex his templates must be to allow for all
        those variations. Turns out he actually authors his site in HTML rather
        than Markdown so that he has the control over the layout that he
        needs.</p>

      <p>This leaves me in a quandry. I don't particularly want to be writing
        HTML whenever I write a post, but it does genuinely seem to be the
        best approach all round. This is something I'll explore in my next post
        when I start planning out the application</p>

      <p>The application will of course require the storage of other data, but
        I'll hold off on using a database until it's utility can justify the
        additional dependency. There lots of other ways of persisting data!</p>

      <h2>The Open Rebuild Begins</h2>

      <date>08 June 2020</date>

      <p>It seems that 2020 is the year of the open site rebuild. So far I've watched as <a href="https://destroytoday.com/blog/hello-world">Jonnie</a>, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/">Frank</a> and now <a href="https://nathansnelgrove.com/redesign-2020/">Nathan</a> put their thought &amp; work process out there for the world to see.</p>

      <p>My site isn't more than a collection of a few blog posts these days, but I've had big plans for it since about 2018, at least according to my journals. I've wanted to post more of my photography, share smaller thoughts more often but also have a place for deep dives and series. Inspiration unashamedly taken from <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/"> Paul's site.</a></p>

      <p>These plans scared me. They are big and imposing, and I struggle to <s>find</s> make time to even update my Twitter bio. An open, incremental rebuild seemed the perfect solution.</p>

      <p>However, whilst I cut my teeth on design, I'm primarily a developer these days, so my public rebuild is going to be a bit different. I'll cover the (minimal) design decisions that I make, but this is going to be about the code that runs the site.</p>

      <p>This site has been built 100 different ways at this point - all of them complete overkill considering it's needs. My personal site has always been a place for to experiment with new ideas and test new technologies. Given all this, you're probably anticipating that I start talking about the hot JS framework du-jour, but instead I'll stop you there.</p>

      <p>Rapidly moving from designer to developer, I missed a lot on the way, most of which could be considered fundamentals. I spent a whole week with only the most basic of CSS selectors before jumping into SASS frameworks (it wasn't Bootstap...what was the other big one?). I learnt JS whilst building a marketplace with MeteorJS &amp; React (that was a wild ride). Using Meteor meant using Mongo, so I was very late to the SQL party!</p>

      <p>I'll be doing my best to follow Jeremy's <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">Resilient Web Design</a> principles, using the native tools of the web to their fullest before cracking open anything more complex. I'll be server-side rendering everything, and I might even stick to using flat files. In short, I'll be coding like it's 1995!</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>

      <p>This seems like an odd thing to do right? Well, as I said, I missed a lot of the fundamentals along the way. I learnt pretty much everything I know about development from reading blogs online, and the problem is that most blogs - particularly today - only talk about building with the hottest of hot tech. Those fundamentals just aren't sexy enough to get much screen time, but they are kinda... y'know... fundamental.</p>

      <p>That's why I want to build this site in the open, always taking the simplest, most resilient and durable path I can; documenting it all the way with articles, guides and source code. I'll examine my options and explain my decisions as I go. I learnt so much from the open web: it's time I gave something back.</p>

      <p>I'm going to be doing this around regular work and looking after an 18 month-old that's just starting to learn his own mind (no easy feat itself) so I can't say how long this will take, or when the next post will go up. I'll try to find a rhythm and make regular updates, but bear with me whilst I find my feet again. It's been a while since shipping <i>anything</i>!</p>

      <p>You'll find the git repo with all the source below, along with a link to my (now) old site. In time I'll move the old content over too.</p>

      <p>That's all for now!</p>
